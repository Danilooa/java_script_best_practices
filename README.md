### Linting

Linting is the process of verifying code quality. This process may identify code snippets that may cause problems is the future.  

[JShint](http://jshint.com/docs/) is an application that verifies problems in JavaScript code.  

JShint is configured in the [.jshintrc](./.jshintrc) placed in the root path of this repository. All the JShint options can be seen [here](http://jshint.com/docs/options/)  .
